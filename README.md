# Simple Bitcoin valuation application

This project is a simple application that provides a realtime display of the valuation of one Bitcoin converted to the US dollar, British pound, and Euro currencies with polling every 15 seconds. Since the endpoint is demo style by nature, the entitlements it has only provide an update to the data every 30 seconds or so. Please keep that in mind while waiting for the interface to update between polling events. 

## Requirements for installation and running the application locallly

- node 16+
